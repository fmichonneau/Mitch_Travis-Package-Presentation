## Why Use Packrat?

-------------


- Isolation
- Portability
- Reproducibility

===========================================================

## Why Use Packrat?

- Have you ever had to use trial-and-error to figure out what R packages you need to install to make someone else’s code work and then been left with those packages globally installed forever???

- Have you ever updated a package to get code in one of your projects to work, only to find that the updated package makes code in another project stop working???


========================================================

## How it works

- Packrat stores your package dependencies inside your project directory
rather than in your personal R library
- This directory is known as your **private library**
- When you start an R session in a packrat project directory, R will only
look for packages in your private library
- if you install or remove a package, those changes are only made to your
private library

========================================================

## How it works

### **Restoring:** the process of istalling packages to private libraries from a snapshot


- Private libraries don't usually travel well since the contents are compiled for your specific computer, OS, and R version
- Packrat takes a **snapshot** of your private library, which it saves to your project directory
- From this, Packrat can re-create the same private library on another computer


Installing Packrat
========================================================

> install.packages("packrat")

Set-up
========================================================

set up the project directory to use Packrat 

> packrat::init:

- do this first thing before typing any other code
- include a path after init if you are not in your working directory  
  + ex. packrat::init("~/projects/pollinatordata")

========================================================
## Congratulations!  You have achieved isolation

-----------

- You’re no longer in an ordinary R project; you’re in a Packrat project. 
- You now have your own private package library
- Any packages you install from inside a packrat project are only available to that project
- Any packages you install outside of the project are not available to the project

Installing Packages in your Private Library
========================================================

*****

> install.packages("reshape2")

> install.packages("stringr")

> install.packages("ggplot")

- install a package the way you normally would

Taking a Snapshot of your Private Library
========================================================

![snapshot](http://pbskids.org/curiousgeorge/games/img/g_icon_snapshot_ovr.gif)

> packrat::snapshot()


Restoring Snapshots
======================================================== 
### If you want to run your project on a different computer
- After copying a project to a new computer, simply launch R from your project directory
- Packrat automates the whole process
- All of the packages in the snapshot will be installed in your project’s private package library.

Check Status
========================================================
> packrat::status()

Restoring Snapshots
========================================================
If you delete a package that you realize later you need or if a collaborator makes a change to a snapshot

> packrat::restore()

Cleaning Up
========================================================
- Packrat analyzes your code to determine if there are packages that were maybe needed at one time but are no
longer used
- You can then tell Packrat to removed these functions

- check the status
> packrat::status()

- Packrat will tell you which packages are installed but not needed
- Remove these unneeded packages
> packrat::clean()

Demonstration 
========================================================
Now we will go through a brief interactive demonstration with Packrat



Slide With Code
========================================================

```{r, eval=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

Slide With Plot
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
